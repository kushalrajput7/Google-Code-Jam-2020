Solution-4
The consortium has decided that distributed systems are too complicated, so they are storing B bits of important information 
in a single array on one awesome machine. 
As an additional layer of security, they have made it difficult to obtain the information quickly; 
the user must query for a bit position between 1 and B, and then they receive that bit of the stored array as a response.
Unfortunately, this ultra-modern machine is subject to random quantum fluctuations! Specifically, 
after every 1st, 11th, 21st, 31st... etc. query is sent, but before the response is given,
quantum fluctuation causes exactly one of the following four effects, with equal probability
